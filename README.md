This repo demostrates my ability to create the logic for a random password generator. The logic was written in JavaScript and takes advantage of fundementals such as functions, if statements, arrays, objects, event listeners, and DOM manipulations through basic Web API.

## Usage

To create a randmomly generated password, first press the "Generate Password" button. You will be prompted to enter the length of the password. Password length must be between 8 and 128 characters long. There will be a few additional prompts asking if you'd like to include lowercase, uppercase, numerical, and special characters. Press "Ok" to include or "Cancel" to not include each password parameter. At least one of these password parameters must be selected. Upon generating the random passowrd, you may press the "Copy To Clipboard" button to instantly copy the newly generated password. Please note that an alert will appear informing you of a successful copy.
